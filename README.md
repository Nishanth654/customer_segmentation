# Customer Segmentation and Ad-hoc Analysis for Online Retail
This project involves ad-hoc analysis and visualization of customer segmentation using an Online Retail Dataset. The dataset contains transaction data, including product details, pricing, and customer information, which is analyzed to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and product performance.

## Overview:
The aim of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and segment them based on different metrics. This can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and increase profitability.

The analysis covers:

Sales trends over time (monthly, daily, and hourly trends).
Top customers and products by revenue.
Customer segmentation by lifetime value, purchase frequency, and geographical location.
Product return rates.
Average order value and customer purchase frequency.
The project includes Python code for analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizations. You can run the analysis either as Jupyter notebooks or as standalone Python scripts.

## Dataset:
The dataset is from an online retail store and contains the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique transaction identifier.
StockCode: Product code.
Description: Product name or description.
Quantity: Number of units sold.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.
CustomerID: Unique customer identifier.
Country: Country of the customer.
The dataset is stored as a CSV file (online_retail.csv), and it's ideal for exploring e-commerce trends, customer profiling, and revenue patterns.
